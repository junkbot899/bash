Ubuntu 24.04.3 (“Noble Numbat”) is already one of the more secure LTS releases, but a default install still exposes several network‑related areas that should be hardened—especially if your system is on a home network in the Sunshine Coast or exposed to the wider internet. The most important steps involve tightening SSH, firewalling unused services, enabling automatic updates, and applying CIS‑aligned hardening. 
🔐 Key Network‑Related Vulnerabilities & How to Harden Them
1. Open or Unnecessary Network Services

Ubuntu ships with a few services that listen on the network (e.g., Avahi/mDNS).
These aren’t “vulnerabilities” by default, but any listening service increases attack surface.
Harden:

    Disable Avahi if you don’t use .local hostname discovery:
    bash

    sudo systemctl disable --now avahi-daemon.service avahi-daemon.socket

    Audit listening ports:
    bash

    sudo ss -tulpn

2. SSH Exposure (Most Common Attack Vector)

Automated SSH attacks begin within minutes of being online.
Hardening SSH is essential. 
Harden:

    Disable password login (use keys only)

    Change SSH port (optional but reduces noise)

    Install Fail2Ban to block brute‑force attempts:
    bash

    sudo apt install fail2ban

3. Firewall Not Enabled by Default

Ubuntu includes UFW but does not enable it automatically.
A system without a firewall is more exposed to scanning and exploitation. 
Harden:
bash

sudo ufw default deny incoming
sudo ufw default allow outgoing
sudo ufw enable

4. Lack of Automatic Security Updates

Unpatched systems are the #1 cause of compromise.
Ubuntu supports unattended security updates, but they must be enabled. 
Harden:
bash

sudo apt install unattended-upgrades
sudo dpkg-reconfigure unattended-upgrades

5. Weak Application Confinement

Ubuntu 24.04 uses AppArmor 4.0, which significantly improves sandboxing—but only if profiles are enforced. 
Harden:

    Check AppArmor status:
    bash

    sudo aa-status

    Ensure key services (e.g., SSH, systemd-resolved, cups) are in enforce mode.

6. Missing CIS Benchmark Hardening

Canonical provides Ubuntu Security Guide (USG) with CIS profiles for 24.04.
These apply industry‑standard hardening automatically. 
Harden:
bash

sudo snap install ubuntu-security-guide
sudo usg audit cis_level1_server
sudo usg apply cis_level1_server

7. Insufficient Logging & Auditing

Without proper logs, detecting intrusions is difficult.
Harden:

    Enable system auditing:
    bash

    sudo apt install auditd
    sudo systemctl enable --now auditd

    Configure log rotation and remote log forwarding if needed.

🛡️ Recommended Hardening Checklist (Network‑Focused)
Area	Action	Benefit
Firewall	Enable UFW	Blocks unsolicited traffic
SSH	Keys only, Fail2Ban	Stops brute‑force attacks
Services	Disable Avahi & unused daemons	Reduces attack surface
Updates	Enable unattended upgrades	Fixes vulnerabilities quickly
AppArmor	Enforce profiles	Contains compromised apps
CIS Hardening	Apply USG profiles	Industry‑grade security baseline
Auditing	Enable auditd	Detects suspicious activity

If you tell me:

    whether your Ubuntu system is desktop, server, or internet‑exposed,

    and what services you run (if any),

I can generate a precise hardening profile suited to your setup on the Sunshine Coast.
